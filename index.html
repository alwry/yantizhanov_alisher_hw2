<h3 class="lb_heading">SpongeBob Squarepants</h3>

<p class="lb_text">
SpongeBob is a childish, joyful, and clumsy sea sponge who lives in a pineapple with his pet snail Gary in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a job in which he is exceptionally skilled at and enjoys thoroughly. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, and his greatest dream in life is to receive his boating license. Unfortunately, he tenses up whenever he has to drive a boatmobile, and he drives recklessly. SpongeBob is very good-natured and loves to hang out with his best friend, Patrick. His teacher is Mrs. Puff and his boss is Mr. Krabs.
</p>

<p class="lb_text">
Like real sea sponges, SpongeBob has the ability to filter-feed (as shown in "I Had an Accident") and reproduce by budding (in "Pressure"). In The SpongeBob Musical, SpongeBob's exact species of sea sponge is identified: Aplysina fistularis, a yellow sea sponge that is commonly found in open waters.</p>

    <h3 class="lb_heading">Squidward Tentackles</h3>
    
    <p class="lb_text">
    Even though Squidward's name contains the word "squid," he is an octopus, not a squid, as confirmed in many interviews and episodes. He has the traits of an octopus—a round bulbous head and rectangular pupils—while a squid has a long triangular head and circular eyes, unlike Squidward. Squids have ten limbs, many more than Squidward. The series' animators believed that giving him eight limbs would be too burdensome and difficult to animate, which is why he is usually depicted with six limbs. Notable exceptions are brief scenes in "Naughty Nautical Neighbors" and "Sold!," in which he has a full set of eight legs. In "Feral Friends," his exact species is identified: a giant Pacific octopus.    </p>
    
    <p class="lb_text">
    He is a very cynical, selfish, sassy, introverted (as he stated himself), and a stick-in-the-mud individual. He works as the cashier at the Krusty Krab, a job he usually hates, most likely due to SpongeBob's annoyance and Mr. Krabs' cheapness. Squidward is frequently annoyed by SpongeBob's loud and cheerful behavior, but he sometimes sticks up for SpongeBob and sees him as a friend.     </article>

    <h3 class="lb_heading">Mr. Krabs</h3>
    
    <p class="lb_text">
    Mr. Krabs is obsessed with money and goes to great length to increase his wealth, to the point where he occasionally treats money better than his daughter and employees. Mr. Krabs' only business competition comes from the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant run by Sheldon Plankton and his wife Karen. Plankton and Karen are constantly scheming to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula that makes the Krusty Krab so successful.    
    <p class="lb_text">
    Mr. Krabs is based on one of Hillenburg's former bosses. When he designed Mr. Krabs, Hillenburg drew inspiration from his former manager at a seafood restaurant. According to Hillenburg, his manager was redheaded, muscular, and a former army cook; these three traits were adapted into Krabs' character, with Krabs' red color standing in for hair. Krabs' speaking manner was also inspired by the restaurant owner, who reminded Hillenburg of a pirate with his strong Maine accent. However, the owner was not greedy, with this detail added by Hillenburg to "give him more personality." </p>

<h3 class="lb_heading">Sandy Cheeks</h3>

<p class="lb_text">
Sandy comes from the state of Texas, known from the episode of the same name, and exhibits many characteristics of a cowgirl character. She speaks with a heavy Southern accent and uses typical Southern slang words and phrases, such as "Howdy" and "Y'all." Sandy is very fond of her homeland and its culture, as most notably seen in the episode "Texas," in which she was homesick and considers leaving Bikini Bottom to return to Texas. In that same episode, she takes great offense at SpongeBob and Patrick's negative insults about Texas and violently attacks them when they continue to make fun of it.</p>

<p class="lb_text">
Sandy is a thrill seeker who loves extreme sports, and karate. Having come from the state of Texas, she has a Southern drawl and a love for rodeos. She works as a scientist and builds both her treedome and air suit and helmet herself. She is also a member of the Gal Pals along with Karen, Mrs. Puff, and Pearl.</p>

    <h3 class="lb_heading">Gary the Snail</h3>
    
    <p class="lb_text">
        He is a domesticated house pet with similar mannerisms to the real-world cat, most notably his "meow" sound, as snails are the underwater equivalent to cats in the show. He also has some abilities of dogs, from fetching to doing tricks. It has been suggested that SpongeBob has had Gary ever since he was a young boy. The episode "Treats!" reveals that Gary was adopted by SpongeBob. In "Plankton's Pet," SpongeBob reveals to have bought Gary at the animal shelter. </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Gary was originally intended to be a minor joke character that would appear in the background of SpongeBob's bedroom, just like SpongeBob's pet scallop Shelley. However, as the series progressed, Gary developed a personality of his own beyond just saying "meow." He was eventually added to the show's Main Model Pack on March 22, 2000 and became one of the ten main characters. </p>   </article>
